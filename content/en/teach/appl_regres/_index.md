# 2. Course Information

R is a language and environment for **statistical computing** and **graphics**. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and colleagues.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.

Linear models, their variants, and extensions are among the most useful and widely used statistical tools for social research. This course aims to provide an accessible, in-depth, modern treatment of *regression analysis*, *linear models*, *generalized linear models*, and closely related methods.
