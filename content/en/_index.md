 The English version of the website consists of a brief [introduction](/en/about/), a [Curriculum Vitae](/en/cv/lzhan/), the [courses](/en/teach/) he teaches, and an English [blog](/en/post/) he writes.

All the pages in this site are written either with *markdown* or with *R markdown*. There is an Edit button <i class="fa fa-edit" aria-hidden="true"> </i> under the title of each post. I will be greatly appreciated if you could click that button and help me to correct the errors or to improve the content of this website.
