This is Likan Zhan's personal website. This website has an [English](../en/) version and a [Chinese](../cn/) version. However, the two versions are not a translation of each other, but contain different contents. The English version consists of a brief [introduction](../en/about/), a [Curriculum Vitae](../en/cv/lzhan/), the [courses](../en/teach/) he teaches, and an [blog](../en/post/) he writes. The Chinese version consists of a brief [introduction](../cn/about/) and a [blog](../cn/post/), as well as a series of [reading notes](../cn/read/).

All the pages in this site are written either with *markdown* or with *R markdown*. There is an Edit button <i class="fa fa-edit" aria-hidden="true"> </i> under the title of each post. I will be greatly appreciated if you could click that button and help me to correct the errors or to improve the content of this website.

The cover image of the web is called [*The brain in a vat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat), which is the philosiphical basis of one of my favorite movies [*The Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). This image summarizes two important questions a cognitive scientist wants to answer: *How our mind works* and *how our brain enables the mind*.
