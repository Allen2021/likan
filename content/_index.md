This is Likan Zhan's personal website. This website has an [English](../en/) version and a [Chinese](../cn/) version. The two versions are not a mirror of each other, but contain totally different contents. All the pages in this site are written either with [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or with [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). There is an Edit button <i class="fa fa-edit" aria-hidden="true"> </i> under the title of each post. I will be greatly appreciated if you could click that button and help me to correct the errors or to improve the content of this website.

The cover image of the web is called [*The brain in a vat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat), which is the philosiphical basis of one of my favorite movies [*The Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). This image summarizes two important questions a cognitive scientist wants to answer: *How our mind works* and *how our brain enables the mind*.
