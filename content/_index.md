This is Likan Zhan's personal website. This website has an [English](../en/) version and a [Chinese](../cn/) version. However, the two versions are not a translation of each other, but contain different contents.

The cover image of the web is called [*The brain in a vat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat), which is the philosiphical basis of one of my favorite movies [*The Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)). They summarize two important questions a cognitive scientist wants to answer: *How our mind works* and *how our brain enables the mind*.
